Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npx playwright test --ui
    Starts the interactive UI mode.

  npx playwright test --project=chromium
    Runs the tests only on Desktop Chrome.

npx playwright test --headed
npx playwright test show-report


  npx playwright test example
    Runs the tests in a specific file.

  npx playwright test --debug
    Runs the tests in debug mode.

  npx playwright codegen
    Auto generate tests with Codegen.

Class-3: How to create and run the tests in VS code
==========
Step 1 - Create a new file under test folder
Step 2 - Add module ‘playwright/test’
    const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');
    
 ** test, expect  ------ functions from @playwright/test module
Playwright Test provides a test function to declare tests and expect function to write assertions

Step 3 - Create a test block - test(title, testFunction)
 The keyword 'async' before a function makes the function return a promise
The keyword 'await' before a function makes the function wait for a promise

Step 4 - Run the test
npx playwright test --project=chromium --headed  FirstTest.spec.js
npx playwright test                 runs all tests on all browsers in headless mode
npx playwright test  MyTest1.spec.js            runs a specific test file
npx playwright test  MyTest1.spec.js  MyTest2.spec.js           runs the files specified
npx playwright test -g "test title"             runs test with the title
npx playwright test --project=chromium      runs on specific browser
npx playwright test --headed        runs tests in headed mode
npx playwright test --debug         debug tests
npx playwright test example.spec.js --debug           debug specific test file
